# Elmoin Github Repo Browser

This is a toy project we play around with at [elmoins](https://www.meetup.com/Elmoin/) to explore the concepts and APIs of elm.

It's currently able to retrieve a complete list of repositories for a given github user.

As we played around with the Tasks-API things might look more complicated here than they had to be if this was a real thing. :)
